### Life mod: ###

The "life mod" has been here since ArmA I, the basic principles are that there are two sides, Blufor a.k.a Cops, and the civilians. Civilians earn money by doing jobs, either legal or illegal. It's up to the civ to become who he wants, a law abiding civvie, a robber, a drugsmuggler and so forth. We plan on hosting two different missions: One without mods, and one with. We'll have a public test next weekend. On our server, we will require players to have a mic and the blufor-side will be trained only to make sure the cop team is proffesional.

### CIV's ###

There's a variety of possibilities to earn money in our mission. Deliveries, fishing (at sea), whaling etcetra. Grow drugs, bank robberies or do contract work with other players. For a full list of jobs and features look below! But it's not only about making money, our mod allows you to roleplay who you want to be, although there will be limits in our server. You must roleplay as much as you can to make for an unforgettable experience, there will be different rules on each server set by the server admins. We plan on making our own servers as serious as possible and a place for players to have fun and enjoy roleplaying.

### COP's ###

Cops are restricted to trained players to ensure decent and professional services. They both have special abilities according to their function to provide the best results. If you think you're up for the challenge, the applications will open once we release the testing version on our servers!
